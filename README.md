### Module 1
- Intro to Machine Learning
- Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning
- Supervised Learning Diagram
  - Training Set: X, t (target)
  - Model: f
  - Test Set: X, t (target)
  - Objective Function: J(w)
  - Learning Algorithm: minimize J(w) or finding the derivative of J(w) and setting it to 0
- Linear Regression
  - Model: f(x) = w^T * x
  - Objective Function: J(w) = (1/2) * sum((f(x) - t)^2)
  - Learning Algorithm: minimize J(w) or finding the derivative of J(w) and setting it to 0
  - Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net# fml-final-cs
